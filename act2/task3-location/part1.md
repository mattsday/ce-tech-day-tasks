Cymbal Supplements is booming!

Their age-reversing hot sauce is flying off the shelves, and they need a new factory to keep up with demand. However, they're not about to build just anywhere. They need a location that's both safe from floods (nobody wants soggy hot sauce!) and close to their ever-growing customer base.

2. They must use BigQuery to analyse the Earth Engine data, and create a geospatial visual representation.
3. They must take a screenshot that illustrates the geospatial data and grid with insights into flood risk factors.
4. Upload the screenshot below
