    upload_text: Upload a screenshot of the Geo Viz map showing high flood risk areas and your SQL query.
    llm_instructions: Ensure the screenshot clearly shows the geospatial data, grid, and evidence of identifying high flood risk areas based on the query criteria. The SQL query should correctly filter for built, water, and flooded vegetation land uses with low slope and HAND values.

    upload_text: Upload a screenshot of the Geo Viz map highlighting potential brownfield sites and your completed SQL query.
    llm_instructions: The Geo Viz map should clearly display potential brownfield locations within the specified area of interest. The completed SQL query should correctly UNNEST the tags and filter for 'landuse' = 'brownfield'.

    upload_text: Upload a satellite view of the Geo Viz map highlighting the top 5 suggested factory locations.
    llm_instructions: The satellite view should clearly show the top 5 brownfield locations identified that are NOT in high flood risk areas. The completed aggregate SQL query should correctly use ST_UNION to group high-risk areas and ST_DISJOINT to find suitable brownfield sites.
