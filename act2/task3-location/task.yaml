  description: Cymbal Supplements needs a new factory! Help them find the perfect spot using geospatial data analysis.
  overview:
    - Cymbal Supplements, experiencing a surge in demand, needs to establish a new factory. Selecting the best location is crucial, requiring a data-driven approach that considers various factors.
    - To determine the optimal location, Cymbal will leverage services to analyse data related to flood risk and specific areas e.g. agricultural land. This will inform their product supply strategy and help them make an informed decision.
    - To keep up with the demand, we need to find the perfect spot for a brand-new factory. But where? We're not just throwing darts at a map ‚Äì we're going full data-detective!

    llm_instructions: The Geo Viz map should clearly display potential brownfield locations within the specified area of interest. The completed SQL query should correctly UNNEST the tags and filter for 'landuse' = 'brownfield'.

    upload_text: Upload a satellite view of the Geo Viz map highlighting the top 5 suggested factory locations.
    llm_instructions: The satellite view should clearly show the top 5 brownfield locations identified that are NOT in high flood risk areas. The completed aggregate SQL query should correctly use ST_UNION to group high-risk areas and ST_DISJOINT to find suitable brownfield sites.
