Alright, listen up, Cymbal crew! You've successfully navigated the treacherous waters of flood risk, proving you're not afraid to get your data wet. But a factory's gotta have customers, right? That's where Part 2 comes in. Cymbal's got a mountain of demographic data, a goldmine of information about where their most devoted hot sauce aficionados reside.

```challenge
Now, it's time to put on your marketing hats and dive into the depths of customer demand. We need you to pinpoint those hotspots, those areas where the craving for age-defying spice is at its peak. Let's see if you can match your flood-safe haven with a customer-crazed paradise!
```

### Task

1. Cymbal also has demographic data that reveals where their most enthusiastic customers reside.
2. Your team must analyze this data (also in BigQuery) to identify areas with high customer demand.
3. They must then aggregate the flood risk data with the demographic data to find the optimal location.
4. They must take a screenshot that shows how Cymbal Supplements is analysing customer demand data.
5. The screenshot must show how the flood data and demographic data is aggregated.
