**Cymbal Supplements: Review Defense Activation!**

Our precious elixir of youth, the Cymbal Supplements hot sauce, is under attack! Those pesky bot-trolls are flooding our review site with fake, age-enhancing (or is it age-reducing?) gibberish! We need to deploy reCAPTCHA Enterprise to protect our reputation and keep the truth about our sauce alive!

You can view the besieged review app here:

```ReviewAppLink

### Task

1. **Forge the Shield!** Head over to the [reCAPTCHA Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/security/recaptcha) and create a new Website key.

```info
Name your key something suitably spicy! "HotSauceShield" or "WrinkleWrecker" perhaps? Let your inner marketing genius shine!
```

2. **Define the Battlefield!** Under "Domain," add the following:

```ReviewAppList
    - `reviews-app-314347289524.europe-west1.run.app`
    - `localhost`
```

3. We're covering all fronts, both production and local testing. Those bots are sneaky!
4. Leave the rest as is. We don't need any extra bells and whistles to kick bot-butt!

5. Enter your Key and Verify! Paste your newly created reCAPTCHA key below. If it's valid, you've successfully activated the first layer of our defence!
