You've successfully ingested the resume data and used Gemini within Agentspace to generate a Suitability Score for each applicant based on the Food Scientist (Sauce Development) Job Description. Now, the Hiring Manager at Cymbal Supplements needs you to narrow down the pool of candidates to the most promising ones. They're particularly interested in the top contenders who closely match the required skills and experience.

::challenge[Leverage Gemini's capabilities within Agentspace to filter the candidates based on the Suitability Scores generated in Part 1. Your objective is to identify the top 2 candidates who appear to be the best fit for the Food Scientist role according to Gemini's analysis.]

### Task

Gemini, through your interaction in Agentspace, must be able to identify and present the top 2 candidates based on their calculated Suitability Scores.

1. Return to your Agentspace environment where you ran the query in Part 1.
2. Formulate a new query (or refine your previous one) using Gemini. This query should:
   - Access the results of the previous analysis, including the Suitability Scores.
   - Instruct Gemini to identify the top 2 candidates with the highest Suitability Scores.
   - Request Gemini to output the names (or identifiers) and their corresponding Suitability Scores for these top 2 candidates.

Provide a screenshot showing the output of your Agentspace query, clearly identifying the top 2 candidates and their Suitability Scores as determined by Gemini.
