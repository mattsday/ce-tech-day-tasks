Cymbal Supplements is exploding! We need a crack team to keep our website running smoother than a freshly blended habanero. But sifting through piles of resumes? That's time we could be spending perfecting our 'Wrinkle-Be-Gone' hot sauce! Let's use Gemini to do the heavy lifting and find the cream of the candidate crop.

First things first, we need to get our ingredients ready. Think of this as prepping the mise en place for our recruitment feast. We've got our resume data in a CSV, and the job description is waiting to be blended into our selection process."

### Steps

1. Open Agentspace: "Fire up Agentspace, our digital kitchen for this challenge. Let's get cooking!"
2. Import **resumes.csv**:
    * "Head to the data import section. We're pulling from Google Drive, so make sure you're logged in."
    * "Find that 'resumes.csv' file in the shared folder. It's the secret recipe for our candidate pool."
    * "Import it into Agentspace. Make sure it's in a format Gemini can understand â€“ like a table. We don't want any lumpy data!"
3. Import Job Description:
    * "Grab the Job Description document from Google Drive. It's our flavor profile for the perfect candidate."
4. TODO - how do we verify this?
