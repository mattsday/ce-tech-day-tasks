### Task

2. Locate the connected data source containing the PDF resumes.
3. Formulate a query using Gemini within Agentspace. This query should:
   - Access the resume data.
   - Incorporate the provided Job Description (you can directly input the text into the query).

   - Request Gemini to output a "Suitability Score" for each candidate based on their alignment with the JD.
4. Ensure you can view the results of your query, including the Suitability Scores for all candidates.
