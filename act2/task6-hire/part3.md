## Part 3: Email Generation - Let's Get Saucy with Interviews! ðŸ“§

**Background:**

Fantastic work! You've narrowed down the applicant pool to the top 2 promising candidates. Now, it's time to reach out and invite them for an interview to see if they have the right blend of scientific knowledge and passion for all things spicy.

**Task:**

Your final challenge is to use Gemini to craft personalized interview invitation emails for each of the top 2 candidates.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Extract Email Addresses:** Utilize Gemini to identify and extract the email addresses of the top 2 candidates from their resume data (which should be available in the Agentspace output from Part 2).
2.  **Generate Personalized Invitations:** For each candidate, use Gemini to generate a personalized interview invitation email. Each email should:
    * Clearly state the purpose of the email: inviting them for an interview for the **R&D: Food Scientist (Sauce Development)** position.
    * Reference specific skills or experiences from their resume (as identified by Gemini in Part 2) to personalize the invitation and show you've reviewed their application.
    * Propose a 1-hour interview and suggest they reply to schedule a convenient time.
    * Include a professional closing with your (fictitious recruiter) name and "Cymbal Supplements".

**Success Criteria:**

* You have successfully retrieved the email addresses for the top 2 candidates.
* You have generated two distinct and personalized interview invitation emails using Gemini.
* Each email clearly invites the candidate for a 1-hour interview and prompts them to schedule.
* The emails include a professional closing.
