We've got our scores, now let's sort the candidates and send out those interview invites. Think of it as packaging up our finest sauce for our most promising customers.

### Task

1. Sort Candidates: "Sort the candidates by their 'Suitability Score', highest to lowest. We want the top 5."
2. Identify Top 5: "These are our finalists! The crème de la crème of Cymbal's future website team."
3. Create Email Generation Agent: "Time for another agent! We'll call this one 'The Interview Inviter'."
4. Configure Email Agent:
    * "Prompt: 'You're a friendly email writer. You'll personalize interview invites for our top candidates.'"
    * "Instructions: 'Read the candidate's resume and their score. Use this info to personalize an email template. Highlight their strengths and why they're a great fit. Keep it professional and enthusiastic. Give clear instructions on how to book an interview.'"
    * "Connect the candidate data and the email template as input."
5. Run the Email Agent: "Generate those personalized invites! Let's get these top candidates excited to join the Cymbal Supplements team."
6. TODO - how do we verify this?
