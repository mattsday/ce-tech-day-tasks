Our AI chef has whipped up a review flow using [Firebase Genkit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit), but we need to know if it's a culinary masterpiece or a kitchen disaster.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it (and you better, because the fate of hot sauce reviews hangs in the balance!), is to validate this flow.

### Task

1. **Enter the Genkit Kitchen**:
    1. Open Cloud Workstations and start your instance: [Cloud Workstations](https://console.cloud.google.com/workstations/overview).
    2. Inside workstations, select **Open Folder** and select **ai-app**
    3. Launch the Genkit console – think of it as the control center for our AI chef. You can do that with this command:

```sh
npx genkit-cli start -- npx tsx --watch libs/genkit/genkit.ts
```

2. **Fire Up the Flow**: Run that review flow like you're cranking up the heat on a ghost pepper. Throw some sample reviews at it – the spicier, the better!
3. **Taste Test the Results**: Make sure the output is as expected. Did our AI chef nail the flavor, or did it burn the sauce?
4. **Capture the Culinary Victory**: Take a screenshot of the Genkit console showing that the flow is working its magic. Think of it as your **"I survived the habanero"** badge of honor.
5. **Serve Up the Screenshot**: Upload that screenshot like you're delivering the winning dish at a chili cook-off.

### Tips

1. Don't be afraid to get creative with your sample reviews. The more ridiculous, the better!
2. Double-check those results. We don't want any accidental "this sauce tastes like feet" reviews.
3. Make sure the screenshot shows the validation process and the successful output. We need to see that spicy success!
