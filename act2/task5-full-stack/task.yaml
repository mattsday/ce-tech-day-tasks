    llm_instructions: Evidence of a screenshot that looks like the provided examples is sufficient. The app does not need to be special. The screenshot should show an App that clearly shows a number of sample reviews (with stars) and an input box at the bottom for a new review to be submitted. Don't award partial points, award 100% if the benefit of the doubt suggests they have successfully started the app.
