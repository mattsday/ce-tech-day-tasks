Our Firestore security rules are currently about as effective as a screen door on a submarine – they need some serious reinforcement. Your mission, should you choose to accept it (and you better, because the fate of Cymbal Supplements' reputation hangs in the balance!), is to fortify those rules and make our data impenetrable.

### Task

1. **Infiltrate the Firestore Fortress**: Navigate to the Firestore security rules in the Firebase console. Think of it as breaking into a heavily guarded spice vault – but legally, of course.
2. **Scout the Security Weaknesses**: Analyze the existing rules like a seasoned spy looking for vulnerabilities. Are there any backdoors? Any loose screws? Any gaping holes in our defenses?
3. **Deploy the Security Enhancements**: Modify the rules to plug those holes and reinforce our defenses. Think of it as adding laser grids, motion sensors, and a team of highly trained pepper ninjas to our security system.
4. **Test the Security Perimeter:** Use the Firebase simulator to test your new rules. Try to break in like a data thief – if you can't, you've succeeded!
5. **Submit the Fortified Rules**: The system will automatically verify your Firestore security rules. If you've created an impenetrable fortress, you'll be swimming in points.
