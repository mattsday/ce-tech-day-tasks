Before we dive into the complex AI flows and cloud deployments, let's start with the basics: getting this app running on your Cloud Workstation.

Think of it as lighting the pilot light before firing up the industrial-sized hot sauce cooker. We need to ensure the foundation is solid before we start adding all those spicy ingredients.

This initial step will confirm you have the necessary tools and can get the app up and running in your own environment, setting the stage for the challenges to come.

### Task

1. **Open the Code**:
   1. Open Cloud Workstations and start your instance: [Cloud Workstations](https://console.cloud.google.com/workstations/overview?project=%%CLIENT_PROJECT_ID%%).
   2. Inside workstations, select **Open Folder** and select **reviews-app**
   3. Select the menu in the top-left and select **Terminal --> New Terminal**
2. **Install the Dependencies:** This is like stocking your spice rack – you need all the right ingredients to make the magic happen.

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Fire Up the Dev Server:** This is like lighting the stove – we need to get that heat going!

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. **Witness the Glory:** Cloud Workstations will popup with a link to your `localhost` instance - if you miss it, check out the **Ports** tab at the bottom to open a preview of your app
5. **Capture the Proof:** Take a screenshot of the review app running in your browser. This is like taking a picture of your first successful batch of hot sauce – proof of your culinary prowess!
6. **Submit the Screenshot:** Upload that screenshot like you're presenting your winning dish at a chili cook-off.

### Tips

- If you encounter any errors, **ask Gemini Code Assist**. We don't want any kitchen fires!
- Make sure your screenshot clearly shows the review app running in your browser. We need to see that spicy success!
