Our review app is like a rocket fueled by habanero peppers – it's ready for launch, but we need to make sure it reaches its destination. Your mission, should you choose to accept it (and trust me, you want to see this baby fly), is to deploy this app to Firebase App Hosting and verify its successful arrival.

### Task

1. **Prep the Firebase Launchpad**: Check out [the documentation for Firebase App Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-hosting) and prepare for launch!
2. **Ignite the Deployment Thrusters**: Use the Firebase CLI to deploy the review  app. This is where you unleash the fiery power of your code.
3. **Verify Orbital Insertion**: Use the special verification button in the task interface to confirm the app has successfully reached its destination. Think of it as mission control confirming a successful landing on the moon – or in this case, Google Cloud.
