Uh-oh.

It looks like you didn't take the time to fix your scaling issues with your website last year. Unfortunately, you've got a few angry customers and a pile of technical debt to clear up.

Before you do anything else you should consider going back to [fixing your infrastructure](/task/act1-task2) and giving it another go? Not completing this task is surely bad for business!
