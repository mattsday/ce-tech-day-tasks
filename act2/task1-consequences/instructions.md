:::scorecondition{sourcetask=act2-task1 minpoints=-500 maxpoints=-1}
*Oh dear, it appears our systems were still experiencing significant issues. Unfortunately, this resulted in lost sales and customer frustration.*

*As a result, every incomplete troubleshooting step has been given a negative score. It's not too late to go back now and fix it.*

## What to Do

You can still go back to **[Fix your ordering systems](/task/act1-task2)** - and we strongly urge you to do so in order to reverse the points deficit!
