# Uh-Oh!

## URGENT ACTION REQUIRED

::warning[You failed to complete the troubleshooting task - the most important task in Act 1! You really need to go fix that ASAP]

*Oh dear, it appears our systems were still experiencing significant issues. Unfortunately, this resulted in lost sales and customer frustration.*

*As a result, every incomplete troubleshooting step has been given a negative score. It's not too late to go back now and fix it.*

### What to Do?

You can still go back to **[Fix your ordering systems](/task/act1-task2)** - and we strongly urge you to do so in order to reverse the points deficit!
