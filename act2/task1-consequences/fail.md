Welcome, Cymbal Supplements team! Your performance in Act 1 has been thoroughly reviewed by our meticulous sales auditors.

## Judge Gemini's Verdict üßë‚Äç‚öñ

Your fate hinges on your ability to restore our production systems in Act 1. Let's see how you fared:

*Oh dear, it appears our systems were still experiencing significant issues. Unfortunately, this resulted in lost sales and customer frustration.*

*As a result, we must deduct **500 points** from your score. However, we believe in second chances! You can return to Act 1 and resolve the issues now. If you succeed, we will revert the penalty.*


## What to Do

You can still go back to **[Fix your ordering systems](/task/act1-task2)** - and we strongly urge you to do so in order to reverse the points deficit!
