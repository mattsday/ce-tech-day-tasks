  description: Cymbal Supplements is going global, and our marketing team wants to analyze customer feedback from all corners of the world! They've recorded call centre chats, but sifting through them manually is aging them faster than our own supplements! Can you use the power of Colab Enterprise and Gemini to understand customer sentiment at scale?
  overview:
    - Our global customer base is raving (or ranting!) about Cymbal Supplements.
    - The marketing team needs a quick way to gauge overall sentiment from audio recordings.
    - Leverage Colab Enterprise and Gemini to perform audio analysis.

      Award points based on the creativity, technical implementation, and relevance to Cymbal Supplements' global expansion. Consider the use of other Google Cloud services like Text-to-Speech for summarizing positive feedback, Imagen for visualizing sentiment trends geographically, or Vertex AI for further analysis (e.g., topic modeling). Look for clear evidence of the implemented extension in the screenshot and the user's description. Encourage solutions that provide actionable insights for the marketing team.

      The examples show a minimal notebook - there should be more complex queries and it should not just be sentiment analysis.
