Welcome to the big leagues! Cymbal Supplements is now a global phenomenon, and our marketing team is drowning in customer feedback from all over the world. Lucky for us, they've been diligently recording audio testimonials. Unlucky for them, listening to hours of "This hot sauce made me feel 20 again!" in seventeen different languages is making them feel... well, old.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it (and you should, for the sake of their youthful glow!), is to leverage the power of **Colab Enterprise** in Vertex AI and the magic of **Gemini** to analyze the sentiment of these audio recordings at scale. Let's turn those vocal vibes into valuable insights!

### Task

1.  Open [Colab Enterprise in Vertex AI](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/colab/overview?project=%%CLIENT_PROJECT_ID%%) within Vertex AI.
2. Select **Import notebooks** and choose **Cloud Storage** as your source.
    - Browse to the bucket `%%CLIENT_PROJECT_ID%%-assets` and select the notebook `audio-analysis.ipynb`.
    - Alternatively, you can simply paste `%%CLIENT_PROJECT_ID%%-assets/audio-analysis.ipynb` into the text field.

::info[Take some time to **read through the notebook**. Understand the initial setup and how it interacts with Gemini. It's like reading the instructions on a new bottle of our age-reversing hot sauce – crucial for optimal results!]

2.  Locate the section in the notebook dedicated to **Sentiment Analysis**.
3.  Use **Gemini Code Assist** within Colab Enterprise to obtain the sentiment analysis from the provided audio interaction. Remember, Gemini is like that one wise (and surprisingly witty) grandparent who just _knows_ how people are feeling.
4.  **Add a new code snippet** below the Sentiment Analysis block by clicking the **+ Code** button.
5.  In this new code snippet, click the **Generate with AI** button (the little sparkle icon ✨).
6.  Enter the following prompt:

```plaintext
    Obtain the sentiment analysis from this audio file
```

7.  **Run this new code segment**. Observe the output – Gemini should provide a sentiment analysis of the audio.
8.  **Take a screenshot** that clearly shows the captured sentiment analysis results generated by Gemini Code Assist. Make sure the output is legible!
