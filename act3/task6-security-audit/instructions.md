# Well Done!

Well done team. You didn't quite do all the security tasks which means you missed out on a sweet multiplier here, but you also didn't completely fail to care about security.

Nice job - although it might be worth just checking your audit logs ðŸ‘€.

# Uh-oh!

What happened team?? Were you _trying_ to get hacked? You literally didn't finish a single security task!

They may not be worth a lot of points at the time, but these foundations surely pay off.

Probably a good time to check if you still have the shirt on your back ðŸ‘€.
