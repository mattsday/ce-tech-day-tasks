## Instructions

1. **Deploy a Slurm Cluster:**
    * Use the provided Cluster Toolkit and YAML blueprint to deploy a Slurm cluster.
    * Ensure the cluster has sufficient compute resources to handle the upcoming AI workload.
2. **Verification:**
    * Provide a screenshot of the deployed Slurm cluster in the Google Cloud Console, showing the nodes and their status.
    * Verify that the cluster is in a running state.

## Scoring

* Successful deployment of the Slurm cluster: 500 points.

## Tips

* Pay close attention to the YAML blueprint.
* Ensure all necessary Google Cloud APIs are enabled.
* Cluster Toolkit is your friend!
