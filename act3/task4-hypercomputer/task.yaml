  description: Deploying the AI Hypercomputer to decode the secret formula of the Inferno Elixir.
  overview:
    - Cymbal Supplements needs to analyze vast amounts of data to perfect the Inferno Elixir.
    - Deploy a Slurm cluster and run an AI optimization program to find the optimal formula.

    upload_text: Upload a screenshot of the deployed Slurm cluster.
    llm_instructions: The user will upload an image of their Compute Engine instance list. Look for evidence of a slurm controller instance and login node. Ignore any other instances (e.g. workstations and so on) as they will have these deployed as part of other tasks they will need to do.
