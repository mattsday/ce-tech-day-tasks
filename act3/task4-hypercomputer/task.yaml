  description: Deploying the AI Hypercomputer to decode the secret formula of the Inferno Elixir.
  overview:
    - Cymbal Supplements needs to analyze vast amounts of data to perfect the Inferno Elixir.
    - Deploy a Slurm cluster and run an AI optimisation program to find the optimal formula.

      The user has submitted a Slurm job across several nodes. They will paste their output below. Ensure it looks generally correct.

      In particular, it should be the results collection, like this:

    upload_text: Upload a screenshot of the login screen
    llm_instructions: The screenshot should show a black login screen with a large number of "S" characters on it. This is the slurm login screen. The attached examples are a good source of inspiration too. Be generous with points. If it looks like a blank terminal screen with S characters then it's most likely a Slurm cluster login and therefore worthy of maximum points.
