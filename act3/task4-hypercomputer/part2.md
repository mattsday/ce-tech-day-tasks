Before running the complex AI optimisation program, you need to verify that your Slurm cluster is functioning correctly. A simple 'Hello World' workload will serve as a test run.

### Task

1. **Login to your controller:**
    * Check out the [Quickstart guide](https://cloud.google.com/cluster-toolkit/docs/quickstarts/slurm-cluster#run_a_job_on_the_hpc_cluster) for instructions on how to login to your slurm controller
2. **Create a Simple Slurm Script:**
    * Write a Slurm script that prints the hostname of the compute node it runs on.
3. **Submit the Job:**
    * Submit the script to the Slurm cluster.
4. **Verification:**
    * Provide a screenshot of the Slurm job output, showing the hostname.

### Tips

* Use basic Slurm commands for job submission.
* Ensure your script is executable on the cluster nodes.
* Check the standard output of the Slurm job.
