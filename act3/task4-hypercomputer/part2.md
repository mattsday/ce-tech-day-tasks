Before running the complex AI optimization program, you need to verify that your Slurm cluster is functioning correctly. A simple 'Hello World' workload will serve as a test run.

## Instructions

1. **Create a Simple Slurm Script:**
    * Write a Slurm script that prints the hostname of the compute node it runs on.
2. **Submit the Job:**
    * Submit the script to the Slurm cluster.
3. **Verification:**
    * Provide a screenshot of the Slurm job output, showing the hostname.

## Scoring

* Successful execution of the Slurm script and verification of the output: 250 points.

## Tips

* Use basic Slurm commands for job submission.
* Ensure your script is executable on the cluster nodes.
* Check the standard output of the Slurm job.
