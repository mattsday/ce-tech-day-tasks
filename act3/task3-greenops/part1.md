The Board of Cymbal Supplements has just announced our new "Green Heat" initiative ðŸ’š!

While our age-reversing hot sauce is making waves, we also want to ensure we're kind to Mother Earth. We've been collecting data on the carbon footprint of our Google Cloud services, and it's time to see who the biggest CO2 party animals are.

Your mission is to use the magic of BigQuery to analyze this data and identify the services that are contributing the most to our carbon emissions.

## Task

1. [Open BigQuery Studio](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=%%CLIENT_PROJECT_ID%%&ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1s%%CLIENT_PROJECT_ID%%!2scarbon_footprint) and navigate to the dataset containing the carbon footprint data for Cymbal Supplements.
2. Explore the data using [BigQuery Insights](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/data-insights). Let it do its magic and see what kind of automatic analysis it generates. Look for key metrics, distributions, and any findings related to Cymbal's carbon emissions.
3. Take a screenshot that showcases the results for the three services producing most carbon emission.
