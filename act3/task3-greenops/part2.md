Cymbal Supplements is scaling new heights, and with great scale comes great responsibility... and multiple Google Cloud Projects! Our "Green Heat" initiative demands we keep a keen eye on our carbon footprint, now broken down by each project. It's time to paint a picture of our project-level emissions using BigQuery Data Canvas.

Your task is to use BigQuery Data Canvas to query the `carbon_footprint` dataset and visualize the carbon emissions for each Google Cloud Project.

You'll then submit a screenshot of your Data Canvas workspace showing both your query and the visualization.

## Task

1. [Open BigQuery Studio](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=%%CLIENT_PROJECT_ID%%&ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1s%%CLIENT_PROJECT_ID%%!2scarbon_footprint), navigate to the carbon footprint dataset. Open Data Canvas associated with this dataset.
2. Using the [Data Canvas](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/data-canvas) interface, build a query that shows that the carbon emissions data per Google Cloud Project.
3. Create a barchart visualisation in Data Canvas that shows the carbon emissions for each GCP project.
4. Take a screenshot of your Data Canvas workspace. This screenshot should clearly show both the visualization you created and the query you built in Data Canvas to generate it.
