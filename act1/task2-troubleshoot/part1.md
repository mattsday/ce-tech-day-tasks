The initial theory? **'It worked perfectly on my laptop!'**

But the reality is a chaotic mess. The Cloud Run service, responsible for handling web traffic, is clearly overwhelmed. It's like trying to push a river through a garden hose.

[Gemini Cloud Assist](https://cloud.google.com/products/gemini/cloud-assist) is your forensic tool here. It's time to dig into the logs, analyze the resource utilization, and understand why this fountain of youth is sputtering. Use Gemini Cloud Assist to understand the underlying issue.

### Task

1. Open the [Cloud Run Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/run?project=%%CLIENT_PROJECT%%) and select the **orders-service**
2. Take a look at the logs to determine the issue and use Gemini Cloud Assist to understand workarounds
3. Upload a screenshot of Cloud Assist helping you with the issue
