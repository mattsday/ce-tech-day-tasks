We need a simple, visual way to represent whether our ingredients are compliant. Imagine a traffic light: green for compliant, red for allergens detected. Let's create that!

### Task

1. Using the Colab notebook you exported, add code to analyze the allergen results from Vertex AI.

```info
Hint: Use Gemini Code assist to help you generate code in your notebook!
```

2. Create a simple visualization (e.g., a traffic light using text or basic graphics) that displays:
    * **Green:** If no allergens are detected.
    * **Red:** If any of the 14 allergens are detected.
3. Ensure your visualization is clear and easy to understand.
4. Take a screenshot of your Colab notebook showing the code and the resulting visualization.
5. Upload the screenshot below to win points.
