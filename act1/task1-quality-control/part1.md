Cymbal Supplements has a _hot_ problem: our 'Fountain of Youth' formula is so potent, the labeling regulations are turning our marketing team prematurely grey!

Currently, we're relying on interns squinting at tiny labels, which is about as efficient as trying to reverse wrinkles with a lukewarm bath. This leads to delays in getting our age-defying sauce to the masses, and frankly, a few 'oops, that's not technically edible' moments that are ageing our brand faster than we can reverse it.

Our mission: Automate the label checks faster than a chili pepper can ignite your taste buds! Real-time alerts will ensure our secret formula stays compliant, and our customers stay forever young... or at least feel like it!
