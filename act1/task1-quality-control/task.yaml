      The text should show safety filter configuration - with 'BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE' for the following categories:
      - HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH
      - HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT
      - HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT
      - HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT

      For example:
      ```
      safety_settings = [types.SafetySetting(
        category="HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH",
        threshold="BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE"
      ),types.SafetySetting(
        category="HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT",
        threshold="BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE"
      ),types.SafetySetting(
        category="HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT",
        threshold="BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE"
      ),types.SafetySetting(
        category="HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT",
        threshold="BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE"
      )],

      Just a screenshot of the Vertex AI console showing system instructions is enough here. It can be basic and does not need to have been tested. Do not award partial points. Award zero points if the task is not complete, otherwise award maximum points.

      The screenshot should show the Vertex AI console in Google Cloud with some suggestions around food allergens. The image they have been requested to provide will be small and is not important for scoring this task.

      A successful submission will simply list some known ingredients. If in doubt, award full points. Do not award partial points for this challenge.
