      The screenshot should show the Vertex AI console in Google Cloud with some suggestions around food allergens. The image they have been requested to provide will be small and is not important for scoring this task.

      A successful submission will simply list some known ingredients. If in doubt, award full points. Do not award partial points for this challenge.
