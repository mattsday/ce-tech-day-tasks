**Welcome, intrepid entrepreneurs!**

Cymbal Supplements has discovered the fountain of youth... or at least, the fountain of 'not feeling quite as old'! But even a miracle hot sauce needs capital to conquer the market. You've stumbled upon a gathering of notoriously picky angel investors – known for their love of both cutting-edge tech and, let's be honest, a good laugh at a struggling startup.

**Your mission:** Craft a 3-minute pitch that will convince these investors that Cymbal Supplements isn't just a gimmick, it's the next big thing. Remember, these investors have seen it all – from AI-powered cat grooming to blockchain-based sock matching. You need to stand out!

### The Challenge:

* **Prep Time:** 15 minutes to concoct your pitch. Think fast, think funny, think 'why wouldn't you want to live forever (or at least feel like you are)?'
* **Pitch Time:** 3 minutes max per team. Keep it snappy, keep it engaging, and keep it...spicy.
* **Investor Panel:** Our esteemed panel (1-2 of our most 'discerning' colleagues) will be judging your pitches based on creativity, clarity, and sheer audacity. Think of them as the Simon Cowells of hot sauce funding.
* **Funding Pool:** We've got a limited pool of points, representing the angel investors' cash. First come, first served. The best pitches get the lion's share, the... less convincing ones... well, let's just say they'll be relying on the 'youth-restoring' properties of their own product.
**The Spicy Twist:** For those brave souls willing to pitch after sampling a generous dollop of Cymbal Supplements' hottest sauce (no milk or water allowed!), bonus points await. This is your chance to prove you're not just a salesperson, you're a true believer... or at least, a masochist with a business plan.
**Presenters:** 1-2 people per team step up to the plate.

### Judging Criteria:

* **Innovation**: How creatively did you present Cymbal Supplements' unique selling proposition?
* **Clarity**: Did you clearly articulate the market opportunity and your business strategy?
* **Enthusiasm**: Did you convey your passion for Cymbal Supplements (even with a burning tongue)?
* **Humour**: Did you make the investors laugh (without making them choke on their own scepticism)?
