Dr. Hotstuff, the eccentric CTO, has a vision to create a fun, viral app. It needs to be **bold**, **fiery**, and hint at the _miraculous age-reversing properties_ of their hot sauce.

She's all about _vibe coding_ and wants you to use [Firebase Studio](https://studio.firebase.google.com/) to bring this vision to life.

### Task

1. **Access [Firebase Studio](https://studio.firebase.google.com/)**
2. **Craft Your Prompt:**
   - Your goal is to generate a fun app that will inspire Cymbal Supplement's users
   - Dr. Hotstuff has provided some... _inspirational_ keywords that MUST be incorporated or alluded to in your prompt and desired output:
     - "Age-reversing hot sauce"
     - "Eternal youth"
     - "Volcanic flavour"
     - "Spicy salvation"
     - "Modern, sleek, vibrant design"
   - Combine these (and feel free to add your own creative flair fitting the theme) into a powerful prompt for Firebase Studio.
3. **Generate and Tweak:**
   - Let Firebase Studio work its magic using your prompt.
   - You can iterate on your prompt or make minor tweaks if the initial result isn't quite what Dr. Hotstuff would call "thermonuclear!"

### Deliverable

Take a **single screenshot** that clearly shows:

1. The Firebase Studio interface
2. The preview of your generated webpage, clearly showing elements like the llama, the call to action, and the general theme.
3. A snapshot of your prompting history
