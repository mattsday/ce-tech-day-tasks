Greetings, Customer Engineers! As you know, Cymbal Supplements is on the cusp of revolutionising the world with our age-reversing hot sauces.

However, a recent shipment of our experimental batches has gone astray! These are critical to our research, and we need your help to recover them. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to locate these lost bottles and return them to HQ.

### Task

Hidden throughout the venue are five bottles of Cymbal Supplements' experimental hot sauces, ranging from the mild 'Youth Elixir Mayo' to the scorching 'Wrinkle Remover Inferno.' Each bottle holds a vital piece of our research, and the spicier the sauce, the more crucial it is to our success.

1. **Clue Gathering**: At the designated table, you'll find a series of clues. These clues will lead you to the hidden bottles. Some clues are straightforward, while others require a bit more... ingenuity.
2. **Bottle Retrieval**: Once you locate a bottle, scan the QR code on its label with your team's device. This will register your find and record the time.
3. **Point Allocation:**
    * Each bottle is worth points based on its spice level.
    * First teams to find a bottle get maximum points, second team half, 3rd team quarter, then just 1 point.
    * Bonus points for teams that find all the mild sauces first.
    * Penalty points for teams that scan the same bottle multiple times.
4. **Taste Test (Optional)**: After the hunt, participate in a voluntary taste test of the recovered sauces. Extra points will be awarded based on your team's bravery and tolerance. Milk and bread will be provided.
5. **Return to HQ**: Once you've recovered as many bottles as possible, return to the designated area for final scoring.

### Hints

1. Work as a team! Collaboration is key to success.
2. Pay attention to the details of the clues.
3. Safety first! Be mindful of your surroundings.
4. Have fun! This is a race against time, and your competitors.

**Let the hunt begin!**
