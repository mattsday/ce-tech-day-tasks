Ah, **'Pure Evil Sauce.'**

A concoction rumoured to be forged in the fiery depths of a chili volcano, whispered about in hushed tones by seasoned spice fiends. It's said that even the most hardened sales colleague sheds a tear when faced with its infernal heat. Locating this liquid inferno will require a quest worthy of a legendary Customer Engineer. You'll need to channel your inner problem-solver, navigate the labyrinth of our tech day, and perhaps even barter with the snack table guardians. Fail, and you may find yourself facing the wrath of a thousand suns... or just a slightly singed tongue.

No pressure.
