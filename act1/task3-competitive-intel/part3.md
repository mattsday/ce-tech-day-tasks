Create an autonomous agent for brand protection and prevent that mud getting all over us!

### Task

Within the Cymbal Agentspace environment, your objective is to develop an autonomous agent capable of generating marketing campaign ideas to counter negative publicity. This agent should be able to:

1. **Receive simple text prompts:** For example, "Generate a social media response to claims that Cymbal Sauce makes time go faster."
2. **Produce creative marketing campaign ideas:** These ideas should be relevant to Cymbal Supplements, address the negative claims (in this case, Chronos Chutney's mud-slinging), and align with brand protection. Think witty social media posts, engaging video concepts, or even humorous counter-arguments.

### Technical Guidance (within Agentspace)

- Explore the available tools and functionalities within the Agentspace platform to create and configure your autonomous agent.
- Consider how you will define the agent's goals, knowledge base (if applicable), and the types of outputs it should generate.
- Focus on the agent's ability to understand the negative sentiment and propose creative ways to address it.
