## Part 3: Unleashing the Autonomous Marketing Brain! ðŸ§ 

**Task:** Create an autonomous agent for brand protection.

**Points:** 1000

**Instructions:**

Within the Cymbal Agentspace environment, your objective is to develop an autonomous agent capable of generating marketing campaign ideas to counter negative publicity. This agent should be able to:

1.  **Receive simple text prompts:** For example, "Generate a social media response to claims that Cymbal Sauce makes time go faster."
2.  **Analyze visual input:** Be able to process screenshots of negative social media posts, articles, or other forms of negative publicity.
3.  **Produce creative marketing campaign ideas:** These ideas should be relevant to Cymbal Supplements, address the negative claims (in this case, Chronos Chutney's mud-slinging), and align with brand protection. Think witty social media posts, engaging video concepts, or even humorous counter-arguments.

**Technical Guidance (within Agentspace):**

* Explore the available tools and functionalities within the Agentspace platform to create and configure your autonomous agent.
* Consider how you will define the agent's goals, knowledge base (if applicable), and the types of outputs it should generate.
* Focus on the agent's ability to understand the negative sentiment and propose creative ways to address it.

**Evidence:**

Upload a screenshot of the configuration or setup of your autonomous agent within the Agentspace environment. Additionally, provide a text-based description of the agent's intended functionality and how it addresses the requirements outlined above.
