## Part 4: Testing the Brand Defender! 🛡️

**Task:** Test the autonomous agent using a simulated negative campaign scenario.

**Points:** 1000

**Instructions:**

Now that you have created your brand protection agent, it's time to put it to the test!

1.  **Simulate a negative campaign scenario:** Imagine Chronos Chutney has posted the following on social media, along with a mock image (you don't need to actually create the image, just describe what it would likely depict - e.g., a clock spinning wildly with someone looking stressed):

    > "Warning! 🚨 Chronos Chutney reveals the shocking truth! Cymbal Sauce doesn't reverse time, it speeds it up! Don't blink, or you'll miss your life! #TimeFliesWithCymbal #ChronoTruth"

2.  **Provide this simulated negative content (both the text and a description of the imaginary image) as input to your autonomous agent.** Use the prompting and input methods available within the Agentspace platform.

3.  **Evaluate the output generated by your agent.** Does it effectively address the negative claims? Is it creative and on-brand for Cymbal Supplements? Does it offer a compelling counter-narrative?

**Evidence:**

Upload a screenshot showing the input you provided to your autonomous agent (the simulated negative campaign text and image description) and the resulting marketing campaign ideas generated by the agent. In a separate text box, briefly explain why you believe the agent's response is effective (or areas where it could be improved).
