Cymbal R&D didn't just *invent* age reversal, they researched its historical precedents! Deep within the R&D vault lies the **Emperor's Chest**. Legend tells of a powerful Emperor, obsessed with living forever (and possibly enjoying spicy feasts for eternity), who stored his most potent secrets within.

He wasn't just paranoid about rivals; he was terrified of misplacing his notes! He devised a cunning locking mechanism based on ancient symbols and sequences, ensuring only someone truly worthy (or desperate) could open it.

::info[**Hint:** Emperors often thought in terms of power, order, and maybe their lucky number. Perhaps the solution involves a specific sequence or alignment? Good luck, future immortals (or at least, future point-scorers)!]
