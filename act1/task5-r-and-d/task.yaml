  description: Cymbal R&D has unearthed ancient puzzles rumoured to hold secrets to longevity. Head to the Puzzle Zone and crack their codes!
  overview:
    - The Cymbal R&D team, in their relentless pursuit of eternal youth (and market dominance!), has acquired three mysterious artifacts.
    - Legends say each artifact holds a piece of the puzzle to unlocking extraordinary vitality – or perhaps just the original recipes for our age-defying hot sauces!
    - Head to the R&D Vault (aka the Puzzle Zone), examine the artifacts, and solve their mechanisms.
    - Each solved puzzle will reveal a QR code containing a fragment of ancient knowledge (and precious points!). Scan it fast!
