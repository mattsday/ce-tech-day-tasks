Ah, the **Grecian Bottle**! The ancient Greeks aimed for immortality through ambrosia and nectar. Our Cymbal researchers theorize that early precursors to our age-reversing, pepper-powered formula might have been stored in vessels like this one, absorbing mystical properties (or just tasting vaguely of olives).

This particular bottle, however, won't just pop open. It's sealed by a devious logical puzzle, likely designed by some philosopher ensuring only the truly wise (or those good at puzzles) could access its potentially life-extending (or cocktail-enhancing) contents.

::info[**Hint**: The Greeks revered logic, harmony, and perhaps the occasional dodecahedron. Look for relationships and patterns between the different parts of the puzzle.]
