# CE Tech Day Tasks

Here is where you define the tasks. The default ones are a great starting point - they allow you to explore Gemini across Google Cloud!

However, if you wish to customise them, then this is the right place! Customisation ranges from simple tasks (e.g. upload a screenshot) to much more complex.

## Contributing

Ideally create a new branch and commit your changes. Then issue a Merge Request in Gitlab.

### Creating New Tasks

Use the [CE Tech Day Gemini Gem](https://gemini.google.com/corp/gem/80226b51667c) to create tasks. Try it out!

### Getting Help

Don't hesitate to ping `mattsday@`!

## Deployment

Tasks go live immediately after deployment - **including updating all pages in real-time**.

For example, if you add a new task it will instantly show up on the leaderboard and be visible in the score-app right away. You can use this functionality as a Hack Director to add a level of excitement into the event.

### To Deploy

The easiest way to deploy is to use Cloud Build. Run `deploy.sh` or `fast-deploy.sh` in this folder.

For faster deployment, use the taks-tool in [utils/task-tool](../utils/task-tool/). This requires Go to be installed.

## Structure

### Folder Layout

At the root is an optional `tasks.yaml` which describes your event. If this is not present then a default configuration is used.

Each task must be configured in a file named `task.yaml` placed inside any sub-folder under this directory structure. For example, your tree could look like this:

- `tasks.yaml`
- `intro/task.yaml`
- `intro/bonus/task.yaml`
- `task1/task.yaml`
- `task2/task.yaml`

## tasks.yaml Configuration

```yaml
---
metadata:
  version: 1
event:
  name: hacksday
  scoring_enabled: true
```

### Instructions Format

Instructions should be written in Markdown format. There are some special instructions that can be sent in addition to all standard Markdown tags.

#### Info

To call out an information block, use an info code block:

````md
::alert[It likely will not work! This is OK! Stay with us.]{severity=info}

#### Important

To mark something as important use an alert code block:

````md
::alert[Important: Ensure you create a new Notebook before continuing]{severity=warning}
````

#### Challenges

To call out a challenge, use a challenge block:

```md
:::challenge
Use Code assist to improve the app!
:::
````

#### Custom Code Blocks

To create custom code-blocks, edit [MarkdownRender.tsx](../apps/score-app/components/MarkdownRender.tsx) in the score app to configure your custom type.

### Custom Components

In situations where you wish to provide a custom component rather than an image upload task you will need to write code for the Score App to render it and also display it.

In the score-app, Look inside [components/custom/Custom.tsx](../apps/score-app/components/custom/Custom.tsx) for an example of how to register a component, and look at [CloudRunDeploy.tsx](../apps/score-app/components/custom/CloudRunDeploy.tsx) for an example of an implementation.

Most likely you will also need to create the scoring logic. Look at [libs/scoring/tasks/task3.ts](../apps/score-app/libs/scoring/tasks/task3.ts) for inspiration.
