      Judges: Review the submitted text. Assess the claims of using AI agents to complete *other* Tech Day tasks. Award bonus points (up to 5000 total per team) based on:
      1.  **Significance:** Did the agent perform a substantial part of the task(s)?
      2.  **Success:** Did the agent achieve the correct outcome for the task(s)?
      3.  **Innovation/Complexity:** Was it a sophisticated use of agents (e.g., multi-step planning, tool use) or just a simple script?
      4.  **Number of Tasks Automated:** Using agents effectively across multiple tasks warrants more points.
      Verify links/evidence provided. Focus on genuine automation/significant assistance. Simple API calls might score low; full task completion via agent scores high.
