### TL;DR: Use Agents to complete tasks

::info[This is a **highly advanced task** for those willing to put in extra effort - and risk - to win sweet, sweet points]

Got what it takes? Prove to judges that you have built & used an agent to automate your work and we'll grant you some bonus points!

We recognise this will take time - so there's quite a few points on offer here. So, dig deep and show us what you've got!

### What counts as an "Agent"?

We're looking for more than just a simple script calling a single API. An AI Agent typically involves:

1. **Goal Orientation:** You give it a high-level objective.
2. **Planning:** It breaks down the objective into steps.
3. **Tool Usage:** It interacts with external systems (Google Cloud APIs, CLIs, SDKs, etc.) to execute steps.
4. **(Semi-)Autonomy:** It can proceed through multiple steps, potentially adapting based on results, with minimal human intervention.

Examples include using frameworks like LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, leveraging Vertex AI Agents, or building your own custom agent logic using models like Gemini.

### The Reward: Glory and Bonus Points! âœ¨

Successfully demonstrating the use of AI Agents will earn your team **up to 5000 bonus points**, added to your overall Tech Day score! Points will be awarded by the judges based on:

- **Significance:** How much of the original task did the agent _actually_ automate or handle? (More = better)
- **Success:** Did the agent successfully achieve the task's objectives? (Correctness matters!)
- **Innovation & Complexity:** Was it a clever, multi-step agent, or a basic automation? (Sophistication is rewarded)
- **Breadth:** Did you apply agents to multiple tasks effectively?

### How to Submit Proof

Talk to your human judges each time you believe you have successfully introduced an Agent to complete the work for you.
