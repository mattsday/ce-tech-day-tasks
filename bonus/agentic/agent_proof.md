Greetings, Cymbal Supplements Innovators!

::info[This is a **highly advanced task** for those willing to put in extra effort - and risk - to win sweet, sweet points]

Our age-reversing hot sauce is a global phenomenon! Demand is through the roof, and frankly, we're struggling to keep up. Manual clicking? Tedious infrastructure management? Ain't nobody got time for that when there's eternal youth (and profit!) to be made!

We need **maximum efficiency**. We need **automation**. We need... **AI Agents** to take the wheel!

::challenge[This is your chance to shine as true masters of modern technology (or laziness, we don't judge). Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to **use AI Agents to complete or significantly assist with other tasks** throughout the Tech Day competition.]

Think:

- Provisioning infrastructure based on task requirements.
- Debugging applications by analyzing logs and suggesting fixes.
- Automating security configurations.
- Generating reports or summaries needed for a task.
- Anything else where you can offload the work to a digital entity!

**What counts as an "Agent"?**
We're looking for more than just a simple script calling a single API. An AI Agent typically involves:

1.  **Goal Orientation:** You give it a high-level objective.
2.  **Planning:** It breaks down the objective into steps.
3.  **Tool Usage:** It interacts with external systems (Google Cloud APIs, CLIs, SDKs, etc.) to execute steps.
4.  **(Semi-)Autonomy:** It can proceed through multiple steps, potentially adapting based on results, with minimal human intervention.

Examples include using frameworks like LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, leveraging Vertex AI Agents, or building your own custom agent logic using models like Gemini.

### The Reward: Glory and Bonus Points! âœ¨

Successfully demonstrating the use of AI Agents will earn your team **up to 5000 bonus points**, added to your overall Tech Day score! Points will be awarded by the judges based on:

- **Significance:** How much of the original task did the agent _actually_ automate or handle? (More = better)
- **Success:** Did the agent successfully achieve the task's objectives? (Correctness matters!)
- **Innovation & Complexity:** Was it a clever, multi-step agent, or a basic automation? (Sophistication is rewarded)
- **Breadth:** Did you apply agents to multiple tasks effectively?

### How to Submit Proof

Talk to your human judges each time you believe you have successfully introduced an Agent to complete the work for you.
